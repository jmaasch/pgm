                Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine
                learning that uses probability distributions to describe the
                world, make predictions, and support decision-making under uncertainty. Underlying this modeling framework is an
                elegant body of theory that bridges two mathematical traditions: probability and graph theory. This framework provides
                compact yet expressive representations of joint probability distributions, yielding powerful generative models for
                probabilistic reasoning.

                This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the formalisms, methods, and applications of this modeling framework. 
                After a review of basic probability and graph theory,
                we explore three dominant themes: (1) the representation
                of multivariate distributions in the intuitive visual language
                of graphs, (2) algorithms for learning model parameters
                and graphical structures from data, and (3) algorithms for
                inference, both exact and approximate.
